​### 3. **ERD Diagram Overview**

Let me describe the main entities and their relationships in the ERD:

​#### **Employees**

<!-- - `id` (PK)
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email` (unique)
- `phone`
- `department_id` (FK -> Departments)
- `position_id` (FK -> Positions)
- `hire_date`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at` -->

​#### **Departments**
<!-- 
- `id` (PK)      
- `name`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at` -->

​#### **Positions**

<!-- - `id` (PK)
- `title`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at` -->

​#### **Attendances**

<!-- - `id` (PK)
- `employee_id` (FK -> Employees)
- `date`
- `status` (present, absent, late, leave)
- `created_at`
- `updated_at` -->

​#### **Payrolls**

<!-- - `id` (PK)
- `employee_id` (FK -> Employees)
- `salary`
- `paid_on`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at` -->

​#### **Leave Requests**

<!-- - `id` (PK)
- `employee_id` (FK -> Employees)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`
- `status` (pending, approved, rejected)
- `reason`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at` -->

​#### **Performance Reviews**

- `id` (PK)
- `employee_id` (FK -> Employees)
- `review`
- `rating` (1 to 5 or any scale you define)
- `review_date`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

​### 4. **Visual Representation of the ERD**
Here’s a rough text-based representation of how your ERD will look:

yaml

Copy code

`Departments 1 ---- ∞ Employees ∞ ---- 1 Positions        |        |     Attendances ∞         |        |     Payrolls ∞         |        |    Leave Requests ∞        |        | Performance Reviews ∞`

​### 5. **Additional Considerations**

- You might want to track additional information, like **Employee Benefits**, **Training Programs**, etc., but this depends on your system requirements.
- You may also want to add other **soft deletion** (e.g., using `deleted_at` timestamps) to some entities for improved data management.

Once you have this ERD in mind, you can start defining the Laravel migrations for your tables and relationships as I mentioned in the previous response.
